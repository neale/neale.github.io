I"ì<p>Iâ€™m Neale Ratzlaff, ðŸŒ² ðŸŒ² a Deep Learning and Computer Vision researcher, currently interning at Horizon Robotics, working on exploration in deep reinforcement learning</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a PhD candidate studying with Dr. <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~lif/">Fuxin Li</a> at Oregon State University.
Iâ€™m broadly interested in implicit variational inference, generative models, uncertainty, and information geometry. Itâ€™s important to create AI agents which we can trust, meaning I spend a lot of time thinking about alignment and paperclips.</p>

<p>Currently Iâ€™m interested in learning distributions over functions, and using them to improve methods in computer vision and reinforcement learning. By leveraging some recent advances in particle vairational inference, we can learn these intractable distributions even for complex neural networks. The resulting distributions have numerous benefits over single models, and even bootstrapped ensembles.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked at Horizon Robotics, <a href="https://vimeo.com/170280447">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.tek.com/">Tektronix</a></p>

<p>We learn an implicit ensemble using a neural generating network. Trained by maximum likelihood, the generator learns to sample from the posterior of model parameters which fit the data. 
The generated model parameters achieve high accuracy, yet are distinct with different predictive distributions. 
We enforce diversity by regularizing the intermediate representations to be well-distributed, while not harming the flexibility of the output distribution.</p>

<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/neale/adversarial-toolbox">Github repo</a></p>

<p>We use an adaptive bilateral filter to smooth the purturbations left by adversarial attacks. We view our method as a piecewise projection of the high frequency perturbations, back to the natural image manifold. Our method is simple, effective, and practical, unlike many other projection defenses</p>
