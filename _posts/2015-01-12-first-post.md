To start off this **Blog** I thought I would give a history of where Ive been on my short ourney so for, starting with my first encounter with a neural net. A year or so ago I came across an npm package called Synapse which gives some functions for defining the behavior of coded neurons.

</div>
{% endif %}

Writing about something is really pleasurable but when it can be writing about the stuff I work with and the stuff that not only can help me but others too is much more like the not writing but drawing childish imaginations with touch of smile in your face .

I hope this blog can show `Codes` and yes some [link](#) and when needed a piece of Picture which is alright , possible .
