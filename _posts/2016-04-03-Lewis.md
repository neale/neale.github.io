Playing with Recurrant Neural Networks is one of those hobbies that really reminds me how powerful these models can be. 
Every since I read Andrej Karpathy's blog [post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) on the absurd power of RNNs
I wanted to try them on my own data. RNNs look more indimidating than other neural network architectures and they unravel data in time. 
That seems scary and difficult, I remember how hard it was to tune my first neural network and have been avoiding RNNs for a long time. 
But their potential to do amazing tasks is enticing. Deep learning can be hard to get people interested in, who might not otherwise have the inclination.
I want to show someone a demo that's better than drawing a better linear seperator than an SVM, or showing object recognition on an image. I want an RNN.
RNNs can learn to caption videos, generate music, or learn to speak. They can also be used to generate images in a crazy hallucination that only a neural net 
could come up with. 


## The Inside of an RNN

Recurrant Neural Networks look more like the goal of AI than a standard neural net. Vanilla feed forward neural networks can take an input, apply a learned function, 
and produce a fixed output. That is, regular neural networks can look at data and reason about it, but really only in some constrained way that's limited by their training scheme. 
The data has no spatial or temporal correlation and the network blindly produces an output. Convolutional Neural Networks were an effort to fix the lack of spatial reasoning 
with respect to images and neural networks. RNNs then are a way to encode information in time into a neural network. The goal of an RNN is to take sequences of data and model
the data as a distribution with respect to time. This puts RNNs in a whole different class of network called a generative model. Generative models can create new information, 
while vanilla nets only exist to answer a heavily formulated and constrained question.

It gets better, RNNs are so powerful that they can operate on any data and draw out a better representation than other machine learning methods. They can develop a 
broader view, or rather contextualize their input by remembering past states of data. Really by feeding sequences into RNNs, you're giving a neural network different states of some larger program, 
and the job of the RNN is to generate a new state.  If you were to give an image to an RNN and a sequence of pixels, then the RNN could generate new states for the image 
for every time step. If RNNs take an input, and produce a new state, than they are in fact generating programs. RNNs are [turing complete](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5401.pdf) 
and can be generalized to form Neural Turing Machines, which build internal states, given an input and output. In other words, given an input and the transformed output, 
a Neural Turing Machine (RNN) can develop the black boxed algorithm that transformes the input state to the output state. Here's a look at what a Neural Turing Machine looks like.

With all this in mind. There's a great open source community based around getting these models up and running in real life. Turnaround from research paper to open source implementation 
is pretty quick these days. As you know, I prefer Torch for pretty much everything. Now Torch isn't great for RNNs, but I don't want to use Theano and Lua is pretty friendy for hacking 
together computational kernels in Torch. I have a lot of things I want to make RNNs do, but with the release of a [convnet approach to copying painting styles](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) 
I thought it would be really interesting to teach an RNN to speak english in the style of one of my favorite authors. My desktop is busted so I'll be training it on an M5 mobile 
processor, but it should work anyway. RNNs don't need to be as deep as the more interesting CNN architectures (I'm looking at you ResNet), I'd never finish anything 
with a 200 layer RNN. So that's the task, in Torch we want to create an RNN that can learn to speak like C.S. Lewis. 

## LSTMs

So lets start building a network. We're going to work with the standard assumption that deep = good. We're going to use torch to stack layers of an RNN in order learn a 
complicated representation of our input-output mapping, or just call it function approximation. And going to train with backprop to optimize a convex error function. 
At the end were going to generate probabilities and pick the likely candidate from the distribution. This all sound standard and boring? Great, now lets start getting weird. 
We're not going to use a Vanilla RNN, because in practice they don't preform as well as other architectures. The most common flavor of RNN that's used in practice is called an LSTM, 
for long short term memory. Its named so because the nodes in an LSTM aren't just mappings to an activation, but instead are their own network of gates and cells. This allows a 
greater measure of control over the memory of the RNN.

> These diagrams are notoriously unintuitive. But the basic idea is that for each of these cells, there is an associated parameter in the network that is learned. 
> The network will learn when to store more information, when to forget (zero the cell), and what operations to preform on the data before the output. 

> The only other thing to note is the sigmoid units before each dot product, this just prevents the gradients from blowing up, which is a common problem with RNNs. 
> I should actually just talk about it.

## Gradient Explosion and Vanishing
RNNs are not a new concept, they were first formulated back in the 1980, with portions of it drawn from older boltzman machines, and others from the even older STM equation 
which describes the application of memory cells but none of that really matters because RNNs are here and they work. But they didn't always, RNN's were rarely used up until a few 
years ago because they were so difficult to train. As with regular neural nets, if you can stabilize the gradients and keep them from saturating, then you can effectively use backprop to 
find a minima of your manifold and train your network. The problem was that this just wasn't happening with recurrent nets, and the reason was because of backpropogation.

> The chain rule representation of the backward pass of backpropogation

During backpropogation you're accumulating all these gradients at each layer during the backward pass. And you are applying them to a basis function, like a ReLU and praying 
that your neurons don't die. If you do this accumulation of a simple model, then you just have summed gradients and there is no issue as long as you regularize and use an 
intelligent basis function. The difference in recurrent nets is that you are multiplying derivitives through multiple time steps at each layer. So you can think about it 
in this framework of that if you have a recurrent net where you're looking back 100 time steps, then you're going to by multiplying 100 derivitives before you can 
pass the input to a squashing unit. If you're gradients are greater than 1 , then your gradient explodes, if they're less than 1, the gradient goes to 0. This is why 
people had so much trouble training RNNs with regular backprop. The signals weren't propogating useful information and the memory structure wasn't useful in practice.
