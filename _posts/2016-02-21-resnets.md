# All About ResNets

I've been wanting to write a post about resnets for some time. They seem like the coolest thing to come out in the last year (I'm looking at you deep compression). 
Resnets are the brain child of Microsoft Research Asia, and they swpet not just ILSVRC 2015, but also MS COCO, Both of which are difficult datasets with lots of competition. 
The most interesting part about resnets is that they were implemented as CNNs with huge depth. Where before a very deep network would look like Google's Inception or VGGnet with 15-20+
layers before threshholding accuracy. Resnets were implemented successfully with 152 layer nets, I encourage you to [read the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) for a primer. 
Microsoft achieved a 6.7% top 5 error rate on Imagenet, which should sit right around human performance. These results were passed recently by facebook's torch implementation where
they took the model to 200 layers and still saw an increase in accuracy beyond MSRA.
