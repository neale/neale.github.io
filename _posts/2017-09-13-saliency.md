Day to day I'm simultaneously impressed and annoyed at the degree of entanglement between real and adversarial features in images. This entanglement problem seems to be the root of the recovery problem. We can't just run small blurring filters over all inputs, because the adversarial signals are so tightly coupled with the real signals. Destory one and you destory everything.
