   	My dream is to live in a world where I can shed my researcher skin, and take up the paintbrush.
	Since I don't live in that world I'm trying to create it by using neural networks to create art that I think is pleasant, and hopefully someone else thinks so too.
	ML-assisted art is this wonderful world where we don't have to worry about SOTA numbers, or whether someone else's method scales better.
	Trying to create something beautiful turns out to be a bigger drive for me than classification accuracy, who knew?
	What's more -- the world of deep learning is finally big enough that the possibilities for artistic expression are endless.

   	In the past I wanted to create music, I really the idea of an AI composer who could freely create music outside the capabilities of humans.
	It turns out that music is really hard: it's absurdly demanding computationally, and human ears aren't very forgiving.
	You can check out my attempt to compose music here at my

   	The images here use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_pattern-producing_network">CPPN</a> to generate images from random neural networks.
	CPPNs only generate one pixel at a time, so we can use them to generate images of arbitrary resolution.
	If you're generating 8K images, I highly recommend using something more powerful than a laptop.
   	If you just want to make some of these yourself, I have a PyTorch implementation up on Github <a href=https://github.com/neale/CPPN">here</a>.
	Its pretty easy to get started, and you can tweak pretty much anything in the code to get different results. All the images displayed here use the same program.

		By using the same CPPN program we can generate a batch of images, and interpolate thousands of frames between them. 
		If we compase the resulting images together we can generate a video of how the neural network responds to different inputs.

	The most interesting thing we can do with a CPPN is to wire them up to a more powerful generative model.
	Below is a CPPN-GAN, where the generator is replaced by a CPPN. 
	Modeling with a CPPN-GAN is hard, as the CPPN lacks the representational power to model complicated structures.
	We can leverage advances in GAN training techniques to some degree -- here I've used a WGAN-GP, which trains very reliably. 
	Still, complicated datasets such as CIFAR-10/CELEB-A remain hard to generate. 
	MNIST is pretty easy even with linear networks, but we really want to use convolutions to capture local relationships.
	Doing this is an open problem however, and I've failed a lot at doing this. 
	CPPN-Autoencoding is my personal goal -- generating arbitrarily high resolution images from small ones without using something like ESRGAN.
